                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>SUBJECT: Service-Caused Damage and Denied Warranty Claim</strong></p>

                <p>Dear Better Business Bureau,</p>

                <p>I am filing this complaint against Samsung Electronics America, Inc. regarding their Mail-In Repair Service, which damaged my device and subsequently denied responsibility for the damage they caused.</p>

                <p><strong>DEVICE INFORMATION:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Model: <span class="placeholder">[Your device model, e.g., Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6]</span></li>
                    <li>Serial Number / IMEI: <span class="placeholder">[Your serial number]</span></li>
                    <li>Repair Claim Number: <span class="placeholder">[Samsung claim/ticket number]</span></li>
                    <li>Purchase Date: <span class="placeholder">[When you bought device]</span></li>
                    <li>Device Value: <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX]</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>ORIGINAL ISSUE:</strong></p>
                <p><span class="placeholder">[Describe the ONLY issue your device had when you sent it in, e.g., "Inner screen protector was peeling at the fold crease. This is a known warranty issue covered by Samsung. The device was otherwise in perfect condition with no damage to the frame, screen, hinge, or other components."]</span></p>

                <p><strong>DOCUMENTATION BEFORE SERVICE:</strong></p>
                <p>Prior to sending the device to Samsung on <span class="placeholder">[date shipped]</span>, I thoroughly documented the device's pristine condition with comprehensive photos and video from all angles, showing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perfect frame condition with no marks, dents, or damage</li>
                    <li>Undamaged screen edges and bezels</li>
                    <li>Fully functional hinge (for foldables) opening and closing smoothly</li>
                    <li>All components in perfect working order except for <span class="placeholder">[the specific issue]</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These dated photos and videos prove the device condition at the time of shipping to Samsung.</p>

                <p><strong>WHAT SAMSUNG DID:</strong></p>
                <p><span class="placeholder">[Describe Samsung's actions chronologically. Examples: "Samsung received my device on [date]. On [date], they canceled my repair ticket without explanation. After multiple calls, Samsung claimed there was 'hinge and frame damage' preventing the free warranty repair and demanded $99 payment. This alleged damage was NOT present when I sent the device in, as proven by my before-service photos. Under pressure and after nearly two weeks without my device which I need for work, I reluctantly paid the $99 to move the process forward."]</span></p>

                <p><strong>DAMAGE CAUSED DURING SAMSUNG'S SERVICE:</strong></p>
                <p>When I received the device back on <span class="placeholder">[date received]</span>, it had multiple NEW damages that were NOT present before service:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Specific damage #1, e.g., "Frame indentation above SIM tray with silver showing through the colored finish—clearly made by a repair tool"]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Specific damage #2, e.g., "Inner screen bezel cracked (approximately 5mm crack)"]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Specific damage #3, e.g., "Adhesive bulging between front screen and frame near USB-C port—clear evidence of improper reassembly"]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Additional damages...]</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>CRITICAL EVIDENCE:</strong></p>
                <p>The shipping box Samsung used to return my device arrived in perfect condition with no external damage, dents, or crushing. This proves the damage occurred during Samsung's repair service at their facility—NOT during shipping. The types of damage (tool marks, bulging adhesive from poor workmanship, bezel cracks) are consistent with service-caused damage, not shipping damage.</p>

                <p><strong>SAMSUNG'S REFUSAL TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY:</strong></p>
                <p><span class="placeholder">[Describe Samsung's response to your complaint about the new damage. Examples: "I immediately contacted Samsung Care+ via email on [date] with photos documenting the new damage. After [number] days with no meaningful response, I called customer service. Samsung denied all responsibility and claimed the damage was 'pre-existing.' When I requested proof (intake photos, technician notes, surveillance footage, chain-of-custody records), Samsung refused to provide any documentation. Samsung then escalated a UPS shipping claim despite the shipping box arriving undamaged, in an apparent attempt to deflect blame to the carrier for damage Samsung caused during service."]</span></p>

                <p><strong>MY ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple calls to Samsung customer service: <span class="placeholder">[dates and results]</span></li>
                    <li>Emails to Samsung Care+ with documentation: <span class="placeholder">[dates]</span></li>
                    <li>Escalation requests: <span class="placeholder">[dates and outcomes]</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite comprehensive evidence and persistent follow-up, Samsung has refused to repair the damage they caused or replace the device.</p>

                <p><strong>FINANCIAL IMPACT:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Original device purchase price: <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX]</span></li>
                    <li>Forced payment for alleged "pre-existing damage" I didn't cause: <span class="placeholder">[$XX]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Optional: "Due to loss of trust in the damaged device and need for reliable phone for work, I was forced to purchase a replacement phone: [$X,XXX]"]</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Total financial impact: <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX]</span></strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>WHAT I'M REQUESTING:</strong></p>
                <p>I am requesting that Samsung Electronics America, Inc.:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Acknowledge responsibility for the damage caused during their repair service</li>
                    <li>Provide a brand new replacement device of equal or greater value at no cost to me, OR</li>
                    <li>Provide a full refund of <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX device value + $XX forced payment = $X,XXX total]</span></li>
                    <li>Compensate me for the time and stress caused by their negligence and refusal to take responsibility</li>
                </ol>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ATTACHED:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before-service photos and videos (timestamped) showing pristine device condition</li>
                    <li>After-service photos showing all new damage</li>
                    <li>Photos of undamaged shipping box upon return</li>
                    <li>Email correspondence with Samsung</li>
                    <li>Repair claim documentation and receipts</li>
                    <li>Timeline of all communications and events</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Samsung's refusal to take responsibility for damage caused during their service, combined with their refusal to provide transparency (intake photos, surveillance footage, chain-of-custody records), constitutes unfair and deceptive business practices. I trusted Samsung with my <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX]</span> device for a simple warranty repair, and they returned it in worse condition than I sent it.</p>

                <p>I respectfully request the BBB's assistance in resolving this matter and holding Samsung accountable for the damage they caused during authorized service.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Sincerely,</p>

                <p><strong>NATURE OF COMPLAINT:</strong> Service-caused damage with denied responsibility, false damage claims, lack of transparency, and deceptive business practices in violation of state consumer protection laws.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Dear <span class="placeholder">[State]</span> Attorney General,</p>

                <p>I am filing this formal consumer protection complaint against Samsung Electronics America, Inc. for unfair and deceptive trade practices related to their Mail-In Repair Service. Samsung damaged my device during authorized repair service, falsely claimed the damage was "pre-existing" to avoid warranty obligations, refused to provide any documentation or transparency, and continues to deny responsibility despite clear evidence.</p>

                <p><strong>I. CONSUMER AND TRANSACTION INFORMATION</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consumer Name: <span class="placeholder">[Your Full Name]</span></li>
                    <li>Address: <span class="placeholder">[Your Full Address]</span></li>

                    <li>Date Received Back: <span class="placeholder">[Date]</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>

                <p><strong>A. Original Issue and Warranty Coverage</strong></p>
                <p><span class="placeholder">[Describe the original issue that was covered under warranty, e.g., "My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 developed a known issue where the inner screen protector began peeling at the fold crease after only [X] months of normal use. This is a widespread issue acknowledged by Samsung and covered under the manufacturer's warranty as a free replacement. The device was otherwise in perfect condition—no damage to the frame, hinge, screen, or any other components."]</span></p>

                <p><strong>B. Pre-Service Documentation</strong></p>
                <p>Understanding the importance of documentation, I took comprehensive photos and video of my device before sending it to Samsung on <span class="placeholder">[date]</span>. This documentation clearly shows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pristine frame condition with no marks, dents, scratches, or damage</li>
                    <li>Undamaged screen edges and bezels</li>
                    <li>Fully functional hinge (for foldables) with smooth operation</li>
                    <li>All components in perfect working condition</li>
                    <li>The ONLY issue: <span class="placeholder">[specific issue, e.g., "3mm screen protector peel at crease"]</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These timestamped photos and videos serve as irrefutable proof of the device's condition prior to Samsung taking possession.</p>

                <p><strong>C. Samsung's False "Pre-Existing Damage" Claim</strong></p>
                <p><span class="placeholder">[Describe Samsung's damage claim. Example: "After receiving my device, Samsung canceled my repair ticket on [date] and claimed there was 'hinge and frame damage' preventing the free warranty repair. This was completely false—my before-service documentation proves no such damage existed. Samsung demanded $99 payment to repair this alleged 'pre-existing damage' before they would proceed with the warranty screen protector replacement."]</span></p>

                <p>When I challenged this false claim and requested proof (intake photos showing the alleged damage upon receipt, technician notes, chain-of-custody records), Samsung refused to provide any documentation. Under duress—having been without my device for nearly <span class="placeholder">[X]</span> weeks and desperately needing it for work—I reluctantly paid the $99 under protest.</p>

                <p><strong>D. Service-Caused Damage</strong></p>
                <p>When I received my device back on <span class="placeholder">[date]</span>, it had multiple NEW damages that were NOT present before service:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Damage #1 with details]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Damage #2 with details]</span></li>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Damage #3 with details]</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Critical Evidence:</strong> The shipping box arrived in perfect condition with no external damage. This proves the damage occurred during Samsung's repair service—NOT during shipping. The types of damage (tool marks, poor workmanship, etc.) are characteristic of service-caused damage.</p>

                <p><strong>E. Samsung's Refusal of Responsibility and Lack of Transparency</strong></p>
                <p>I immediately contacted Samsung on <span class="placeholder">[date]</span> with detailed photos of the new damage. Samsung's responses demonstrate a pattern of evasion and deflection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="placeholder">[Describe Samsung's responses and tactics]</span></li>
                    <li>Denied all responsibility for obvious service-caused damage</li>
                    <li>Refused to provide intake photos, surveillance footage, or chain-of-custody records</li>
                    <li>Deflected blame to shipping carrier despite undamaged shipping box</li>
                    <li>Provided contradictory information across multiple representatives</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>III. DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES</strong></p>

                <p>Samsung's conduct violates state consumer protection laws through the following deceptive and unfair practices:</p>

                <p><strong>A. False Damage Claims to Avoid Warranty Obligations</strong></p>
                <p>Samsung falsely claimed "pre-existing damage" without providing any evidence, despite my comprehensive documentation proving otherwise. This tactic appears designed to extract payment for repairs and avoid warranty obligations under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.</p>

                <p><strong>B. Lack of Transparency and Refusal to Provide Evidence</strong></p>
                <p>When challenged to prove their damage claims, Samsung refused to provide any documentation (intake photos, technician notes, surveillance footage). This lack of transparency prevents consumers from challenging false claims and suggests Samsung has no evidence to support their allegations.</p>

                <p><strong>C. Service-Caused Damage with Denied Responsibility</strong></p>
                <p>Samsung damaged my device during authorized service then denied responsibility, despite clear evidence the damage occurred while in their possession. This breaches their duty of care as a bailee and may constitute unfair trade practices.</p>

                <p><strong>D. Deflection and Blame-Shifting Tactics</strong></p>
                <p>Despite the shipping box arriving undamaged and damage consistent with service issues (not shipping), Samsung attempted to deflect blame to the shipping carrier. This appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid accountability.</p>

                <p><strong>E. Pattern of Similar Consumer Complaints</strong></p>
                <p>Research reveals numerous similar complaints from other consumers experiencing identical tactics: false "pre-existing damage" claims, service-caused damage, denied responsibility, lack of transparency, and deflection to shipping carriers. This suggests a systematic pattern rather than isolated incidents.</p>

                <p><strong>IV. FINANCIAL HARM</strong></p>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>V. REQUESTED RELIEF</strong></p>
                <p>I respectfully request that your office:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Investigate Samsung Electronics America, Inc.</strong> for unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of <span class="placeholder">[your state's consumer protection statute]</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Order Samsung to:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide me with a brand new replacement device OR full refund of <span class="placeholder">[$X,XXX total]</span></li>
                            <li>Reimburse all costs associated with their negligence</li>
                            <li>Reform their repair service practices to include mandatory intake documentation and transparency</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Investigate the pattern of similar complaints</strong> to determine if Samsung's practices constitute systematic unfair/deceptive trade practices affecting multiple consumers</li>
                    <li><strong>Impose appropriate penalties</strong> for violations of state consumer protection laws</li>
                    <li><strong>Require Samsung to improve transparency</strong> by providing intake documentation and chain-of-custody records to consumers who dispute damage claims</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>VI. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION</strong></p>
                <p>I have attached comprehensive documentation including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before-service photos/videos (timestamped) proving pristine condition</li>
                    <li>After-service photos documenting all new damage</li>
                    <li>Photos of undamaged shipping box</li>
                    <li>All email correspondence with Samsung</li>
                    <li>Repair receipts and claim documentation</li>
                    <li>Complete timeline of events</li>
                    <li>BBB complaint filed on <span class="placeholder">[date]</span> and Samsung's inadequate response</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>VII. CONCLUSION</strong></p>
                <p>Samsung's conduct—false damage claims to avoid warranty obligations, service-caused damage with denied responsibility, lack of transparency, and systematic deflection tactics—constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices that harm consumers. I am not alone in this experience; research reveals numerous similar complaints suggesting a pattern of problematic business practices.</p>

                <p>I respectfully urge your office to investigate this matter, hold Samsung accountable, and protect other consumers from similar harm. Consumers should be able to trust authorized manufacturer repair services, but Samsung's practices have destroyed that trust.</p>

                <p>Thank you for your attention to this serious consumer protection matter. I am available to provide any additional information or documentation your office may require.</p>
